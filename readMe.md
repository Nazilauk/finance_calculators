To get started, open the financial_calculator.py file in a Python IDE or command prompt.
You will be prompted to choose either the 'investment' or 'bond' calculator.
If you choose the 'investment' calculator, you will be prompted to enter details such as the deposit amount, interest rate, number of years, and type of interest (simple or compound). The program will then calculate and display the amount of interest earned.
If you choose the 'bond' calculator, you will be prompted to enter details such as the present value of the house, interest rate, and number of months taken to repay the bond. The program will then calculate and display the monthly repayment amount.
If you make an incorrect selection, the program will display an error message.
